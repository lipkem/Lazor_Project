# Lazor Project

This Python project provides a simple code that takes a bff imput file that represents the elements of a level in a game of Lazors and outputs a solution in the form of a text file with a grid of A blocks (reflection blocks), B blocks (opaque blocks), and C blocks (refraction blocks).
