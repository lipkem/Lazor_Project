# Read BFF File
  # Find and Read Grid
    # Define grid dimenstions and allowed/unallowed space (likely need to double size of grid space to accomodate for lazors and target)
      # Even number should indicated the rows/columns in between blocks, odd numbers indicate block location
      # Note: even numbers will be unallowed for blocks (probably doesn't need to be coded in output though)
  # Find and define blocks and block types
    # 
  # Find and define laser number, location, and direction

  # Find and define targets (points where lazers need to intersect

  # Output should be the grid (in an array/matrix), the block types and location, the laser locations and directions, and the target locations
